# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide intended to help students keep and organise their notes during the prework segment of the bootcamp. I was motivated to create it because I am one such student and I don't have a pen and paper. This project will solve the problem of keeping notes without killing trees, debilitating hand cramps and improving readability of said notes by typing instead of writing them by hand. I learned a lot about Github and git bash and look forward to getting more comfortable with everything during the course.
